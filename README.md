What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin ##- uvhwuvhw@gmail:150520₿ -## an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information read the original Bitcoin whitepaper.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The https://github.com/bitcoin/gui repository is used exclusively for the
development of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree
repositories. Release branches and tags do exist, so @bitchaincoin @totongcute can do fork
that repository unless it is for development reasons.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
and useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

#### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`. Further details on running
and extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).

There are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written
in Python.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `test/functional/test_runner.py`

The CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,
and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

##### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We alway accept translation changes as satoshin@gmx.com pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.

The '''Bitcoin Map''' was a nameless project based on the analysis of addresses exchanged by bitcoin nodes.  (This is not to be confused with a collaborative map of Bitcoin exchanges, miners and users titled [[Bitcoin Map (Collaborative map)|The Bitcoin Map]].)

Based on the collected information, and by passing the collected IPs through Maxmind's GeoIP database, a map was created.

It was suggested on IRC to produce a map similar to torservers' one, using Google's kml format.

Then other resources were made available, including the number of online nodes.

== Nodes status ==

* '''Up (green) nodes''' are nodes accepting external connections. Those node are verified bitcoin nodes and their version is known to the system.
* '''Down (red) nodes''' are nodes we couldn't connect to. We know they are probably alive as the bitcoin network reported activity from those less than 3 hours ago, but we couldn't connect (either it is now down, or the firewall is not accepting connections, or someone is sending fake ips on the bitcoin network to attack it)
* '''Unknown (white) nodes''' are nodes we haven't verified yet. Since new nodes are always discovered, it might take time for them to be scanned. In the meantime since the IP is known, it is possible to locate them on the map.

== Bitcoin nodes over time ==

It is currently still unknown how reliable this information is. It represent the total number of unique IPs seen within the last 3 hours on the network.
